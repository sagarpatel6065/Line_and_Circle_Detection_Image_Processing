# Image Processing Techniques: Line and Circle Detection

This repository contains MATLAB code demonstrating the implementation of line and circle detection techniques using the Hough Transform in image processing.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase the application of Hough Transform in detecting lines and circles within images. The repository includes two main functions:

1. `line_detection`: Detects lines in an image using the Hough Transform and superimposes the detected line on the original image.

2. `circle_detection`: Detects circles of a specified radius in an image using the Hough Transform and displays the detected circles on the original grayscale and edge images.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2016b or later
- Image Processing Toolbox

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sagarpatel6065/Line_and_Circle_Detection_Image_Processing.git
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.

3. Modify the code as needed or use the provided sample images.

4. Run the MATLAB scripts:
   - To detect lines: Run the `line_detection` function in MATLAB.
   - To detect circles: Run the `circle_detection` function and specify the radius of the circles you want to detect.

## Functions

### `line_detection`

This function demonstrates line detection using the Hough Transform.

```matlab
function line_detection()
% ... (rest of the function code)
end
```

### `circle_detection`

This function demonstrates circle detection using the Hough Transform.

```matlab
function circle_detection(Radius_of_Circle)
% ... (rest of the function code)
end
```

## Sample Outputs

Sample images, both original and processed, are provided in the repository. You can use these images to test the line and circle detection functions.
